# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Plan

1. Make it responsive:
    1. 1200px breakpoint added, change the banner on the right to invisible
    2. Change it from a left to right, to a stack.
    3. Adjust for spaces and report back
2. Change background to suit foreground
    1. Test darker shades
    2. Look up what shades work with white and pink
3. Check and if more edits are needed update here

4. Icons , audio displays
